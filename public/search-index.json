In this open and lawless world, if you are not cautious, someone else will take advantage and steal your money. A few things to consider when you are active in DeFi:\nNever Share Your Seed Phrase or Private Key Never share your seed phrase or private key with anyone. Keep it somewhere safe and, if you want to keep it in digital form, use password managers like Bitwarden with a strong password. Your public address which in BSC and similar networks starts with 0x is somehow safe to share with others, but NEVER ever do NOT share your private key / Seed Phrase with anyone, and I mean anyone (even your spouse).\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Be Rushed In DeFi, there\u0026rsquo;s a rule of thumb: if someone rushes you to:\nSending funds or your tokens to get airdrop or 2x, 3x, or whatever amount of your tokens or coins, even if it seems like the person is someone famous like Elon Musk. Participating in some presale on the verge of filling the cap. Connecting your wallet to a website to get a reward, fix your issue, or any other claim like this. There\u0026rsquo;s a very big chance they\u0026rsquo;re going to steal your money or assets. Do not rush into anything. Always double/triple check.\nKeep Your OS Clean Be sure the OS you use is clean and does not contain any malicious software. Always install software from trusted sources like App Store and Google Play.\nAdmins Don\u0026rsquo;t DM First Admins NEVER DM you first on social platforms. If you get a random message, the possibility of it being spam or scam is 100%. Report them.\nAdmins Don\u0026rsquo;t Ask for Funds Admins never ask for funds or your tokens. Do not send your funds or tokens to any address. Please be wary if even an admin asks you to do that. Always check with the main group for further info. Again: Do not send your funds or tokens to any address.\nFollow the Right Links Do not follow links other than those Admins/Mods with Admin/Mod tags send. Do not follow links that are sent to you in the name of Admins in your PV.\nDouble-Check Everything Do not connect your wallet to any website unless you are 100% sure you are in the right place. Double-check the URL and also the lock sign beside the URL to prevent MITM attacks.\nBeware of Random Tokens Do not approve or sell tokens that appear from nowhere on your wallets, and do not participate in airdrops unless you are 100% sure about the legitimacy of the project.\nRewards Can Be Traps If not 100% almost all of those posts which claim to reward you or 2x or 3x your tokens by sending them or connecting your wallet in order to get them are scams. Please do not send your hard-earned assets to anyone or do not connect your wallet in order to get a reward.\nStay vigilant and cautious when navigating the DeFi space. By following these guidelines, you can minimize the risk of scams and losses and protect your valuable crypto assets.\n","date":"2023-09-07","id":3,"permalink":"/docs/guides/defi-safety-guide/","summary":"DeFi is the wild west of Crypto.
