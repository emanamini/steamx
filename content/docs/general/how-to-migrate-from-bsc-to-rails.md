# How to Migrate SteamX Tokens from BSC to Rails Network

Migrating your tokens from BSC to Rails network is a straightforward process. You can watch a [video tutorial](https://t.me/c/1556440172/1127211) on how to do it or follow these easy steps:

1. **Use a Compatible Wallet:**
   Ensure you are using a compatible wallet. We strongly recommend MetaMask. If you already have SteamX (BSC) tokens in another wallet, you can import your Seed Phrase into MetaMask and continue using the other wallet. Check this [guide](https://t.me/c/1556440172/1124201) on importing TrustWallet into MetaMask without transferring tokens [here](https://t.me/c/1556440172/1124201).

2. **Select Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Network:**
   If you are using MetaMask, select "BNB Smart Chain" as your network. The migration takes place under the BSC network.

3. **Use the Wallet's Built-in Browser:**
   If you're on a smartphone, use the built-in browser of your wallet. Otherwise, on a PC, open the browser that has the MetaMask extension.

4. **Navigate to Migration Page:**
   Go to [https://depot.steamexchange.io/migrate](https://depot.steamexchange.io/migrate)

5. **Connect Wallet:**
   Click "Connect Wallet" and approve it in your wallet. You are now connected to our depot.

6. **Approve the Migration:**
   Click "Approve" on this page.

7. **Set Spending Cap:**
   A dialog will open in your wallet asking for a spending cap. Round up the number for sure approval (e.g., if it's 17459.1235465, make it 17460).

8. **Confirm Transaction:**
   Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

9. **Initiate Migration:**
   Your tokens are ready for migration. The "Migrate" button is now activated. Click on it.

10. **Approve Transaction:**
    Approve the transaction in your wallet.

11. **Successful Migration:**
    You have successfully migrated to our chain. Follow this [guide](https://t.me/c/1556440172/1124199) to add Rails Network to your wallet.
