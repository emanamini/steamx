# Guide to Buying SteamX using MetaMask and our Bridge

## Step 1: Install MetaMask

You need a wallet. We recommend MetaMask for seamless integration with our network. Install it from a trusted source. Visit their website for legitimate download links: [metamask.io](https://metamask.io)

If you are using TrustWallet, you can import your Seed-Phrase into MetaMask and use it at the same time. Please follow this guide on [How to Import TrustWallet into MetaMask](/docs/general/import-tw-into-mm/).

## Step 2: MetaMask Setup

After installing MetaMask, you'll have a public address starting with 0x. This address remains the same across all networks MetaMask supports, including Rails and Ethereum Network. Add our network to MetaMask using [this guide](/docs/rails-network/add-rails-to-metamask/).

## Step 3: On-Ramper and ETH

Find an on-ramper supporting Ethereum in your region or use a centralized exchange (CEX). Purchase ETH and send it to your Ethereum address. Ensure you have all the funds you want to use for buying SteamX in ETH.

## Step 4: Swap to USDC via Uniswap

Since our bridge supports USDC, swap the desired amount to USDC on Uniswap. Keep about 0.01 ETH in your wallet for gas fees. [app.uniswap.org](https://app.uniswap.org)

## Step 5: Use Our Bridge

Follow [this guide](/docs/trading/bridge-usdc-to-rails/) to send your USDC to Rails network.

## Step 6: Swap on SteamX Exchange

After sending your USDC to Rails network, go to our swap: [swap.steamexchange.io](https://swap.steamexchange.io)
Connect your wallet. Press the arrow to send SteamX to the below box and then select USDC in the above field.

## Step 7: Confirm the Swap

Press "Swap" and confirm it in your wallet.
