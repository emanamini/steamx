# Bridge USDC from Rails to Ethereum

This guide walks you through the process of bridging USDC between the Rails and Ethereum networks using our depot.

## Requirements:

Ensure you have the following assets in the Ethereum network wallet you want to bridge with:

1. About 10 to 20 USD in ETH for covering gas fees.
2. The amount of USDC you want to bridge.

## Important Notes:

- Use a compatible wallet like MetaMask.
- Have enough ETH on the Ethereum network to cover gas fees.
- Do not refresh the webpage during the process.
- Use the built-in browser of your wallet if you are using a smartphone.

## Steps:

1. Open the bridge in our depot under the SteamX Holder tab: [Depot Bridge](https://depot.steamexchange.io/bridge)
2. Connect your wallet using the "CONNECT WALLET" button.
3. On the page, click "Select Network" and choose: Rails → Ethereum.
4. Authorize & sign the amount of USDC you want to bridge.
5. Approve the transaction in your wallet.
6. Deposit your USDC by pressing the “Deposit” button. Ensure you have enough ETH for depositing and claiming. Do not refresh the webpage.
7. After depositing, claim your USDC on the Ethereum network. Click "Claim" and approve the transaction in your wallet.
8. Congratulations! Your USDC is now on the Ethereum network.
